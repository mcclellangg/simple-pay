    A function to calculate state withholding amount each week.
    Will take gross pay(G), and # of exemptions as arguments(E1), and return
    the amount to be withheld for this pay period. This function will assume
    that the pay periods(P) occur on a weekly basis. This function also assumes there will
    be no calculations for people 65+, or taking blind exemptions.

    (G)P - [$3,000 + (E1 X $930) + (E2 X 800)] = T

    A function designed to calculate federal withholding amounts on a weekly basis.
    For simplicity sake, this function will be designed to work for Single or Married Filing Seperately individuals only.
    It will also assume that the employee does not have multiple jobs (Using a W-4 form that is from before 2019 or 2020
    and beyond but not checking the box in step 2 on that form). This formula will also only solve for someone with an annual
